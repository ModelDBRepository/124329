<body><p>The LNSC (Laboratory for Natural and Simulated Cognition) package, contains
the lab neural network simulator. This extremely flexible and extensible package
includes numerous variations of <i> Cascade-Correlation</i> neural networks
(including thh&nbsp; <i>Knowledge-Based</i> version) and <i>Backpropagation</i> neural networks.
It also contains an implementation of <i>KBANN </i>as well as <i>Optimal Brain
Damage</i> algorithm for cascaded networks. It contains many
type of nodes and can easily be extended to use user-defined type of nodes.
Similarly it contains many optimization algorithms and can easily be extended to
user defined-ones. It also uses user-defined stopping criteria and can compute
at run-time any user-defined statistics about the network under training on
training and testing data or undergo any other user-defined analysis operation.
Finally, all these, including the networks themselves can be recorded and
saved for further analysis.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The library spirit is to make every single piece of a learning system a block
and to build learning algorithm from these blocks. The building blocks of the
library stand in one class and few interfaces.&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
  <li>The class&nbsp; <a href="DataSet.html">DataSet</a>&nbsp; is a general data
    holder. It is used to put training or testing data and to gather outputs as
    well as intermediate results and calculations.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>The interface <a href="FunctionalUnit.html">FunctionalUnit</a> provides
    the general interface for any&nbsp; classifier or function approximator. A
    functional unit is a real-vector-valued multi-variate function that may or
    may not be differentiable. For example, single processing element in neural
    networks as well as whole networks are functional units. (The library
    contains around 17 functional units.)</li>
  <li>The <a href="page/Index.html">page</a> subpackage provide the necessary
    interface to build artificial agent moving in artificial world like game
    playing program, artificial grid-world, etc...</li>
  <li>Others subpackages are not necessarly part of the LNSC package.</li>
</ul>
