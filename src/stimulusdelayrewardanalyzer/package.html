<p> Documentation is provided 'as is' and may be incomplete or not totally
up-to-date with the code. <p>

<p>This code is provided 'as is', and options beyond the one currently used in 
the simulation may not have been tested completely and may not be working. 
As often in research, this is a prototype.</p>

<p>This program is a Java package containing the original simulation software 
used to perform the present simulations. No publication or commercial 
derivatives can be made without the author’s written consent. On the other hand, 
researchers who would like to have more options to try to make predictions and 
plan animal experiments are welcome to contact the author [FR]; model options, 
environmental or tasks options, as well as options to include other models can 
be discussed.</p>
